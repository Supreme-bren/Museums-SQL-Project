# Museum Project
-Welcome to my Data Visualization project. A project that I created to display United States musuems data from 2014.
The data was excracted and manipulated in SQL Server Manaagment Studio using SQL, and the dashboard and data visualizations 
were created using Tableu. My Musuem Dashboard allows you to anaylze the impact that musuems have in society and the
economic benefit of having museums in the United States. The dashboard shows information like "Musuems Per Capita", "Revenue Per Capita",
and breaking up the musuems into types and showcasing how many exist in each state in the United States.
